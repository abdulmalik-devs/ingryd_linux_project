# Project Overview

This repository consists of three main projects:

1. **Ansible Project for Package Installation and User Creation**: This project uses Ansible to automate the installation of packages on Ubuntu and Red Hat Linux distributions. It also creates a dedicated Ansible user with sudo privileges for secure execution of tasks. The project leverages roles, tasks files, and a playbook to ensure consistent and repeatable configuration across multiple hosts.

2. **Bash Scripting Project**: This project contains a set of bash scripts designed to automate various tasks including file backup, system metrics reporting, Oracle database schema backup, and email notifications. The scripts are modular, allowing you to run individual scripts based on your needs.

3. **File Sharing Protocols - Samba and NFS**: This project provides an overview of the Samba and NFS file-sharing protocols, their importance in real-life scenarios, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with each. It also provides insights into how these protocols can be used in different environments.

Each of these projects has its own detailed README file that explains how to use the project, the requirements, and any additional information or instructions. Please refer to the individual README files for more details.
